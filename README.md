# Introduction to Machine Learning: Course ISE - 364 / 464

![](Intro_to_ML.png)

Material for the course ISE-364/464, titled "Introduction to Machine Learning". This includes all original lecture slides that I created as well as homework assignments, projects, and the placement exam accompanying the course.

I originally built this course and taught it in the Fall 2024 semester at Lehigh University in the Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) Department. Two sections of this course were taught in tandem: a 364 section (for senior undergraduate students) and a 464 section (for graduate students).
As such, the lecture material remains the same for both sections, but the graduate section is simply augmented to have more difficult problems in the homework assignments and projects.

The material herein can be used in a variety of university, industrial, or recreational uses: to teach a university or industry-oriented introductory course on machine learning (ML), to serve as a comprehensive reference source for the fundamentals of the field of ML, or even topic-specific seminars (as the lectures are broken down by topic and are relatively independent from each other).

I will maintain this repository and keep the material updated if any edits are required. Further, I may develop more advanced material for future education in more specialized topics (deep learning, data mining, statistics, and / or optimization, etc.) which I will distinguish from the core course material as "special topics".

Please send any comments and corrections to me at gdk220@lehigh.edu. Further, if you are a course instructor seeking complete solution write-ups for the homework assignments, again, please email me at the aforementioned address.

## Course Overview & General Outline

Machine learning (ML) is the study and development of algorithms that learn patterns from data in
an automated way and is the bedrock of the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This is an introductory course in ML
designed for senior undergraduate, master, and doctoral students who have a working knowledge of Python
and sufficient knowledge in probability, statistics, multivariable calculus, and linear algebra. This course introduces
the core principles of ML, fundamental techniques & models, data mining methodology, and prepares for more
advanced study in ML. Emphasis will be placed on introducing ML models in an intuitive way from the
fundamental mathematical building blocks in order to gain a deep understanding of the assumptions preceding each
algorithm. The learning of these concepts will be facilitated with homework assignments that will consist of a
mixture of mathematical and coding problems (emphasis will be placed on the mathematics behind the algorithms and experience applying these models in practice).
